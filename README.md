# 2018_C-Game_-Marmotsw-

Marmot Sleepwalker is a platform game i created for the Capstone final assignment for "CS-50 introduction to computer science" with Edx Harvard University Online. 
It's a 12 levels platform game with an increasing difficulty. 
Built upon my previous Mario Sokoban project. I changed the concept and added many features (items,ennemies,music,etc).

Please download Marmotsw.rar or install_Marmotsw.exe in the Install folder if you want to have a go.

NB: I provide all the code and game files, except the music folder as my project exceeded the limit of 100 files.
