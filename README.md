Marmot Sleepwalker is a platform game developped as the final project for CS-50 computer science program with Edx Harvard University Online. 10 levels platform game with increasing difficulty. Used previous Mario Sokoban project and improved the game in many directions (items, ennemies,music,etc)

NB: I have included all the code, except the music folder as it exceeded the limit of 100 files.
The game can be installed through the installer or the .rar can be unzipped in order to experience the game
