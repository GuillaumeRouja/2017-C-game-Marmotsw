# 2018_C-Game_-Marmotsw-

Marmot Sleepwalker is a platform game i created for the Capstone final assignment for "CS-50 introduction to computer science" with Edx Harvard University Online. 

It's made of 12 levels with a time limit; the last one is quite tricky! 

Built upon my previous Mario Sokoban project. I changed the concept and added many features (time limit,items,ennemies,music,etc).

Please download Marmotsw.rar from the Install folder and launch the .exe file if you want to have a go.

NB: I provide all the code and game files, except the music folder as my project exceeds the limit of 100 files.

I'd be glad to have your feedback on the code and the game.
